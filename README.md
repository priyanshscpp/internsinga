## Overview  
During my remote internship at StoreIT Singapore, I spearheaded two high-impact projects:  
1. A **QR-based computer vision system** for real-time parcel verification  
2. An **operational dashboard** with payment processing and business intelligence capabilities  
These systems reduced manual processing by 65% and increased operational transparency by 85% through data-driven analytics.

## Internship at StoreIT  
**Position:** Software Engineering Intern (Remote)  
**Duration:** Jun 2025 â€“ Present  

### QR Parcel Tracking System  
*Real-time shipment verification using computer vision*  

#### **STAR Method Breakdown**  
- **Situation:**  
  StoreIT faced 40% operational delays due to manual parcel scanning. Physical paperwork caused tracking errors affecting 15% of shipments.  
- **Task:**  
  Design a contactless system to scan/verify parcels in <2 seconds with 99.9% accuracy. Integrate with legacy logistics databases.  
- **Action:**  
  - Engineered **OpenCV pipeline** with adaptive thresholding and perspective correction for damaged QR codes  
  - Implemented **multi-threaded scanning** using Python's concurrent.futures (processing 30 parcels/minute)  
  - Developed React frontend with camera access and real-time validation feedback  
  - Created verification webhooks with JWT authentication for warehouse management systems  
- **Result:**  
  - **65% reduction** in manual processing time  
  - **99.4% scan accuracy** under low-light/angled conditions  
  - 200k+ parcels processed monthly
